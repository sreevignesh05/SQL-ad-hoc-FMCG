- As a product owner, I need an aggregate monthly gross sales report for Croma India customer so that I can track how much sales this particular customer is generating for AtliQ and manage our relationships accordingly.

- Create a stored procedure for monthly gross sales reports so that I don't have to manually modify the query every time so that I generate this report without involving the data analytics team.

- A stored procedure that can determine the market badge based on the following logic <a href="" target="blank"><img align="center" src="https://img.icons8.com/?size=100&id=JBsFFuVDTkKw&format=png&color=000000" width="35" /></a> If total sold quantity > 5 million that market is considered Gold else it is Silver.
